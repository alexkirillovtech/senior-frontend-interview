- What is your experience with Agile or Lean methodologies, and how do you incorporate these approaches into your design process?

Continuous Delivery: Continuous delivery is a key principle of Agile and Lean methodologies. This involves delivering small, incremental changes to the design and codebase, rather than large, monolithic updates. This approach allows for more frequent feedback and iteration.

Iterative Development: Iterative development is another key principle of Agile and Lean methodologies. This involves building and testing small, functional pieces of the design at a time, rather than designing the entire product upfront. This approach allows for more flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements and user needs.

Collaboration: Collaboration is a fundamental principle of Agile and Lean methodologies. This involves working closely with other members of the team, such as developers, product managers, and stakeholders, to ensure that the design process is aligned with the overall goals of the project.

- Can you explain the difference between responsive design and adaptive design, and when you would use each approach?

- How do you ensure that your user interfaces are performant, and what tools do you use to measure performance?
- Can you explain how you would optimize the loading time of a large web application?


- What is your experience with user authentication and authorization in web applications, and what tools or libraries have you used to implement these features?


- Can you explain the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering, and when you would use each approach?

- Can you explain how you would ensure that a web application is secure and protected from common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection?

- What is your experience with internationalization and localization of user interfaces, and how have you implemented these features in past projects?
